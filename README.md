# OpenShift Wildfly Cartridge
This cartridge is currently in beta status while I make sure that everything works.

You can build a gear using this cartridge with the following command:
	
	rhc app create wildfly https://raw.github.com/developercorey/openshift-wildfly-cartridge/master/metadata/manifest.yml
	
It will take a few minutes to build, so be patient.
